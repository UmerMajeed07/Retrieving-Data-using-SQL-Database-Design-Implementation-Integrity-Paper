a) An evaluation of the quality of the work you have produced with reference to both the specified
requirements and the assessment criteria. You should include:
- any deliverables that are not complete or fully tested;
- elements of the practical work that you feel contribute to higher grade achievement;
- your approach to design and testing of the SQL and Python elements of the assessment;
- how well you feel you managed your time between the four parts of the assessment and what more you would
have done if youâ€™d had more time.

b) Bibliography and references

I have been able to complete all the three questions completely  and tested out with all the use cases in the
question # 2.
I have used a class based python design structure to implement the question 2 along with the docstrings for the
explanation of what each function do with the parameters input and return types. Added proper comments to code for
better explanation of the piece of code does.
Handled the wrong input exceptions while getting input from the users i.e giving non integer values as input i.e "abc".
Added the usage of python packages such as used "tabulate" for the tabular printing of data. Added the package
dependency file and a README file for others to how to install and run the program.
